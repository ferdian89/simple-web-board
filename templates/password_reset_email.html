Hi there,

Someone asked for a password reset for the email address {{ email }}.
Follow the link bellow:
{{ protocol }}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

In case you forgot your Django username: {{ user.username }}

If clicking tje link above doesn't work, please copy and paste the URL in a new browser window instead.

If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user enterd your email address by mistakes while trying to reset a  password. Id you didn't initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can safely disregard this email.

Thnaks,
